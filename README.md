# rpg-cpp

## Introduction

This is one of the first small projects I made during my career change training to learn more about the C++ programming language and cmake. With the self imposed rule to only use built-ins and no other dependencies except the build tool.

I have originally written it in python but moved it over to C++ later on.

It's a simple turn based RPG for the CLI.

## Installation

Clone the repository into the desired location and have cmake installed.
Create a folder and move into it, then run

```sh
cmake ..
```

and after that run

```sh
make
```

## Running the game

In the terminal move into your build directory and run the executable rpg-cpp
